kadeSustains
- If true, note tails will look a little weirder, like earlier Kade Engine builds.

onDestroySustainSize
- Do not touch this one!
- This will be set to what the Note's global sustain size was before being reset.

customSustainSize
- This value is the new global sustain size until the song has finished or you've entered a new game state.
- The Note's global sustain size value by default is 44. The one in the json should be 22, which divides the sustains' size by half.

pixelSustainSize
- Do not touch this one!
- Because of how pixel stage sustains work, it doesn't seem to use the Note's global sustain size variable. To fix this, we
take Note's new sustain size, and divide it by the old one. When sustains spawn, its size will be multiplied by this value.
	customSustainSize (22 for this example) / onDestroySustainSize (44) = 0.5
	sustain scale (y) = said size * 0.5 (this is basically dividing it by 2)

newNoteOffset
- The notes' offsets can be a bit restrictive, since it's bounded to a max value. If your notes are REALLY off, set this value. But
it's recommended to use the one in your options if your notes aren't offset past whatever its max value is.

noCliprect
- If true, the sustains won't clip through their strum lines. Instead, they'll just be killed.

allowFullAlphaSustains
- If true, sustains will have their alpha set to 1 instead of their usual 0.6. This just like Kade Engine.
